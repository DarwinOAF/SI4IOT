# SI4IoT: Integration Methodology for IoT Systems

## Description
`SI4IoT` is a development environment for the integration of IoT systems using a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) methodology. It allows modeling IoT applications through a Domain-Specific Language (DSL), enabling the automatic generation of software artifacts from developed models and the integration of heterogeneous hardware. This approach helps developers focus on the application’s business logic without dealing with the complexity of underlying platforms.

## Project Structure
The project follows an architecture divided into three main layers, each with a specific purpose and defined sub-levels for better organization:

1. **Physical Layer**: Contains models related to the hardware components that are part of the IoT devices.
   - **Infrastructure Sublevel**: Defines network characteristics, servers, and connectivity.
   - **Hardware Sublevel**: Describes the sensors, actuators, and controllers in the system.
2. **Logical Layer**: Defines the system’s control logic and communication. This layer is responsible for service orchestration and the implementation of integration patterns.
   - **Control Sublevel**: Includes the logic for device management, such as REST service orchestration and event management.
   - **Interaction Sublevel**: Enables communication between the Physical and Application layers through RESTful APIs and lightweight messaging patterns (e.g., MQTT).
3. **Application Layer**: Provides the necessary interfaces for the end user’s interaction with the system.
   - **DTV Level**: Models the user interface for digital televisions.
   - **Mobile Level**: Defines the user interface for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

## Key Features
- **Layered Modeling**: The modular architecture allows the solution to be divided into layers, facilitating development and integration.
- **Custom DSL**: Domain-Specific Language designed to abstract technological complexity and ease model development.
- **M2T Transformations (Model-to-Text)**: Automatic transformation of models into functional source code, enabling software artifacts generation for multiple languages and platforms.
- **Heterogeneous Component Integration**: Manages interoperability between IoT devices through RESTful APIs, MQTT, and other protocols.
- **Multiplatform Support**: Software artifact generation for platforms such as Arduino, Node-Red, Android, NCL-Lua, and Ballerina.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation on the methodology, DSL usage, and examples for its implementation in different contexts.

## Installation
1. Download and install **Eclipse IDE** with MDE-compatible tools.
2. Install the following plugins in Eclipse:
   - **Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)** for metamodel definitions.
   - **Sirius** for graphical editor creation.
   - **Acceleo** for Model-to-Text transformations (M2T).
3. Clone this repository into your local environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/acgtic211/si4iot
```
4. Import the project into Eclipse (`File` -> `Import` -> `Existing Projects into Workspace`) and ensure all dependencies are correctly configured.

## Basic Usage
1. **Create a new Sirius project**: Open the Sirius graphical environment to define the different layers of the model.
2. **Define the infrastructure**: Configure the elements of the infrastructure sublevel, such as network and node characteristics.
3. **Model the hardware**: Add hardware components (sensors, actuators, controllers) and define them in the graphical editor.
4. **Establish control logic**: Create the logical layer with REST service orchestration and define events for communication between devices.
5. **Create the user interface**: Use the editor to design DTV and mobile interfaces.
6. **Transform the model**: Generate the corresponding code using Acceleo for specific platforms (Arduino, Node-Red, Android, Ballerina, etc.).
7. **Implementation and deployment**: Deploy the generated code on the corresponding platforms and perform the necessary testing.

## Available Examples
The repository includes examples to illustrate the implementation of the methodology in different contexts:

- [Smart Home](examples/home_automation/): Implementation of a smart home environment with temperature sensors, lighting control, and remote monitoring.
- [Industrial Automation](examples/industry/): Monitoring and control system in an industrial environment with heterogeneous devices.
- [Smart Agriculture System](examples/agriculture/): IoT solution for monitoring environmental conditions and irrigation control in an agricultural setting.

## Source Code Structure
The code is organized into the following directories:

- **`src/core/`**: Contains the base classes and core components for the integration architecture.
- **`src/integration/`**: Modules for integration with various IoT technologies.
- **`src/dsl/`**: DSL definitions and model-to-text (M2T) transformations.
- **`src/application/`**: Specific elements for the applications' interaction with end-users.
- **`docs/`**: Detailed documentation covering user guides, configuration, and reference manuals.
- **`tests/`**: Scripts for unit and integration tests to validate the functionality of different system components.
